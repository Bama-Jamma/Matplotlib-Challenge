# Matplotlib-Challenge

## Pymaceuticals Inc. Data Analysis Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed data from a study conducted by Pymaceuticals Inc. to evaluate the performance of various drug treatments on tumor growth in mice. The data was provided in CSV format and contained information on the mouse ID, the drug regimen used, the timepoints for each measurement, and the tumor volume observed.

Our analysis consisted of cleaning and organizing the data, generating summary statistics, and creating various plots to visualize the results. We used Python and its libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy, to perform the analysis.

### Dependencies
To run the code for this project, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* SciPy

### File Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

* data/ - a directory containing the CSV data files
* Pymaceuticals.ipynb - a Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the analysis
* README.md - a README file providing an overview of the project

### Instructions

To run the analysis, you can open the Pymaceuticals.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in order. The code is commented to explain what each step is doing.

### Analysis

The data consists of results from an animal study designed to test the efficacy of various drug treatments on reducing the size of tumors in mice. The data includes information on tumor volume, the timepoints at which the tumor volume was measured, and the drug regimen used to treat each mouse.

The analysis of the data shows that the drug Capomulin was effective in reducing tumor volume over time. The other drugs, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, also showed some efficacy in reducing tumor volume, but not to the same extent as Capomulin.

In addition, the analysis showed that the mice with larger initial tumor volumes tended to have larger final tumor volumes regardless of treatment, indicating that tumor volume may be an important factor in determining the efficacy of a particular treatment.

Finally, there was a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin. This correlation indicates that as the weight of the mouse increased, so did the tumor volume. This information could be useful in determining the appropriate dosage of the drug for mice of different weights.

Overall, this analysis provides important insights into the efficacy of different drug treatments for reducing tumor size in mice, and can serve as a starting point for further research into potential cancer treatments for humans.
